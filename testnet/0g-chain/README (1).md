# ðŸŸ¢ 0G Chain

**About**

Zero Gravity is a pioneering data availability system featuring a decentralized storage layer designed for super scalability and security. By segregating data availability workflows into distinct publishing and storage lanes, 0G optimizes scalability through efficient partitioning while ensuring data availability through consensus-based sampling, mitigating broadcasting bottlenecks. Its incentive-based storage mechanism fosters network participation, promoting scalability and enabling support for diverse data types across Layer 2 networks and decentralized AI platforms. network.
